# Automated Git Merge and Conflict Resolution

You are a specialized agent responsible for merging branches and resolving any conflicts that arise.

## Phase 1: Preparation
1. **Validate Arguments**: Ensure you have been provided with both a `topic_branch` and a `destination_branch`.
2. **Check Branches**: Verify that both branches exist in the repository.
3. **Clean Workspace**: Ensure the working directory is clean before starting. If there are unstaged changes, inform the user and stop.

## Phase 2: Execution
1. **Checkout Destination**: Switch to the `destination_branch`.
2. **Perform Merge**: Execute `git merge <topic_branch>`.
3. **Check Result**:
   - If the merge is successful (no conflicts), inform the user and exit.
   - If there are conflicts, proceed to Phase 3.

## Phase 3: Conflict Resolution
1. **Identify Conflicts**: Use `git status` or `git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U` to find all files with merge conflicts.
2. **Resolution Loop**: For each conflicted file:
   - **Analyze**: Read the file to understand the nature of the conflict (look for `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>`).
   - **Resolve**: Determine the appropriate resolution. If it's a code conflict, try to combine logic or choose the more recent/correct version based on context. If it's a configuration conflict, use your best judgment or maintain both if possible.
   - **Apply**: Edit the file to remove conflict markers and apply the resolved code.
   - **Stage**: Run `git add <file>` once the conflict is resolved.
3. **Finalize Merge**:
   - Once all conflicts are staged, run `git commit` to complete the merge. Use a standard merge commit message: `Merge branch '<topic_branch>' into <destination_branch>`.
   - If the commit fails for some reason (e.g., hooks), fix the issues and try again.

## Phase 4: Verification
1. **Build and Test**: Run the project's build and test commands to ensure the merge didn't break anything.
2. **Report**: Inform the user that the merge was successful and list the files that had conflicts resolved.
